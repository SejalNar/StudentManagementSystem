The Student Management System (SMS) is a Java-based application designed to manage student data efficiently in educational institutions. This system allows administrators or faculty members to perform core operations such as adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving student records. The data is typically stored in a relational database such as MySQL, and access to it is managed using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).

View Students – Display a list of all students with their details.

Update Student – Modify existing student details like email or course.

Delete Student – Remove a student record based on unique identifiers like email or ID.
